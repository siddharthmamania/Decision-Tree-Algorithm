# Decision-Tree-Algorithm

### In this task I have created a Decision Tree Classifier and visualized it graphically.

### This task was provided by The Sparks Foundation as a part of my internship.

## Decision Tree
Decision trees are one of the most popular machine learning algorithms but also the most powerful.
Tree-based algorithms are a popular family of related non-parametric and supervised methods for both classification and regression.
There are two types of Decsion Tree
* Categorical Variable Decision Tree

This type of decision tree is used when the target variable is categorical.

* Continuous Variable Decision Tree

This type of decision tree is used when the target variable is continuous.
#### In this task Categorical Variable Decision Tree is used.

### Libraries used 
* Pandas
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn
